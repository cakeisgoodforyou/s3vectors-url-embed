## About Me

My name is Andy Clynes and I am a data, analytics, devOps and GenAI professional with over 10 years industry experience.
Starting in data analytics and data science I later transitioned into data engineering and then again into operations engineering / devOps
in order to get the complete end-to-end data and analytics stack experience.

Recently I have also expanded into AI engineering and this page is designed to showcase some interesting projects I have been developing.
